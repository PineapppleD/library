### API 
I used NYT books api, this is not the best books API at all. I used this API because it was the only API I could find and could work with.
If you know other APIs that are used for the same purpose you can use them.
How to use NYT books API? 
  1. create an account
  2. get your API key
  3. create a file .env to store local variables
  4. create a variable for api key
  5. use that variable in your code

#### database
I used localstorage instead of databases like mongoDB or SQL. That's why users are created in your local browser, not in a database system
